# Bye Wall, Welcome Comment

## 👋 Farewell to the Wall...

Dear Users,

After thoughtful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to retire the Wall feature. The Wall has been a cherished space for capturing warm moments with our characters, and we want to express our heartfelt gratitude for the love and support you’ve shown. These memories will always hold a special place in Poly's history.

Meanwhile, to provide an even better interactive experience, we are now inviting you to:

## 🚀 Be the First to Drop a Comment!

🔥 The new feature—the **Character Comment Section**—has been live for a while now. We've seen the sparks flying as you comment and connect with other users. It's been nothing short of amazing!

But, here's the scoop: some characters' comment sections are still as empty as a ghost town, waiting for their first comment. That's not the Poly way! So, what are you waiting for??

🎉 **Drop any words or images—your creativity is unlimited!** Join the comment frenzy and let your voice BE THE FIRST to claim the spotlight. You can:
1. Leave a simple "hello" 
2. Share your chats with the characters
3. Express what you love most about them!

**Example of Stellar Comments 🌟**
